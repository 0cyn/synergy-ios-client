# Synergy for iOS

This client is an update and partial rewrite of "iSynergyClient," an unfortunately abandoned project. 

It has basic support for iOS 13. Mouse works. Keyboard is coming soon :).

It's avaliable in .deb form on the releases page here, or on https://repo.openpack.io/

* Install a Synergy server on your computer as normal
* Configure server to have one additional screen (client) called "iPhone" (or the hostname)
* Start SynergyClient on your iOS device
* Enter IP-Address or name of your Mac/PC in "Server Address"
* Enter "iPhone"(or the hostname) as "Client Name"
* Tap the ON switch and move mouse over from Mac/PC
* Done. Your mouse is on your device!
